SurveyMonkeyApi
===============

.NET library for querying the Survey Monkey API. Install it with NuGet: PM> Install-Package SurveyMonkeyApi

Usage notes are at https://www.simple-talk.com/blogs/2014/08/10/new-net-library-for-accessing-the-survey-monkey-api/

This fork is an attempt to add wrappers for some of the missing api calls like create_collector, create_flow, send_flow etc.
